                    <p> Micro-Interactions are like any other interactions with devices, which are used to communicate
                        meaningful feedback to the users because a user has to constantly know what happens when an
                        action is
                        performed. Itâ€™s a human tendency to expect something to happen when you click a button, scroll a
                        page,
                        add an item to the cart, left swipe a card.</p>

                <h3>SVG basics</h3>
                <h4>What is SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics</h4>

                <p>previously we have exported vectors and drawings in design programs such as Adobe Illustrator. But
                    the
                    content inside the SVGfile is code looking and working like HTML. This means we are able to code SVG
                    directly in our HTMLfile. </p>

                <p>important: Now that SVG are vectors and fluit we do not work with px but units. This is why the
                    drawingboard here dont have any descriptopn but 100X100</p>


                <div class="split">

                    <img src="exampleOne.png" alt="first example">

                    <div class="example">
                        <svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
                            <rect width="5" height="7" x="1" y="1"></rect>
                        </svg>
                    </div>


                    <p>Inside the SVG tag you can work with a wide array of elements. In this case a rectangle.
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element">SVG element reference</a>
                    </p>


                </div>




                <p>now that we have created an SVG file directly in the HTML we are able to animate it using CSS. It is
                    just
                    a matter of selecting the right elemet</p>

                <div class="split">
                    <img src="ExampleTwo.png" alt="second example">


                    <div class="example">
                        <svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
                            <rect id="exampleOne" width="3" height="5" x="3" y="3"></rect>
                        </svg>
                    </div>

                    <p>This means we are able to animate the most crasy SVG files if we are able to select the right
                        elements.
                    </p>
                </div>


                <br>
                <aside>
                    <p>one importent element when coding are the 'g'. the is SVG version of a 'div'. the 'g' groups
                        elements
                        in the SVG together.</p>
                </aside>

                <p>With this basic knowledge about SVG and how we are able to manipulate it I have created several
                    microinteractions elements you can try out yourself.</p>

<p>In illustrator I drew the SVG icon I wanted to animate. Here a set of eyes</p>

<p>i placed the svg in my HTML and arranged the different elements with 'id' tags. As you can see the svg has already been styled directly in the html. This styling are integrated in illustrator</p>
